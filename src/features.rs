/**
    Calculates the distance from the date of the match to the earliest and newest match date in data set.
    The match date is converted into a Unix Timestamp. The earliest and lates match dates as timestamp
    act as min and max for the normalization.
    
    **Rationale**:

    * More recent matches a valued higher than earlier matches.

    **Example**:

    * The earliest match in the data set is on 2019-05-12 Unix Timestamp 1557619200
    * Date of the current match is 2019-10-02 Unix Timestamp 1569974400
    * The last match in the data set is on 2019-11-02 Unix Timestamp 1572652800
    * The value for the game day factor is 0.8218 (a relative recent match)
    * Future matches (those without a result have values > 1.0)

/**
    Used if the data set contains matches from various leagues and inter league matches.
    Assigns a str_radix to designate each league.

    Takes the league field of a match and converts the String into an integer then f64
    Rationale: Allows to add a non-judgmental feature that represents the overall strength
    of the league, which may be relevant in inter league matches (ie Open Cup) or in a Pro-Rel System.
    It also allows some separation between phases of a season, if the field league is used that way.
    
    **Example**:

    * The data set consists of matches from the the German Bundesliga, UK Premier Leaguge, and NISA.
    * The matches of NISA show Team A to be very strong, however compared to other leagues in the
    Data set, Team A may be less successful.

    The String radix allows to add that feature without ranking the league by personal opinion.
    A first Division league in Tibet may be weaker than a 4th Division NPSL league.
    
    If matches in a regular season are marked differently than for instance play-offs, friendlies
    or off-season matches, it may allow the network to pick up patterns in the roster or changing the strategy
    of the teams throughout those phases.
    
    **Example**:
    
    * Team A tries out new formations and a more offensive play in a pre-season or a friendly, than
    in the play-offs. If there's a pattern. The network will pick that up and may be able
    to produce better predictions knowing that a result of a friendly is less reliable than a play-off result.
